<h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy – Re2buy Used Cars</h1>
<div class="date">Last Updated: 31 December 2025</div>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
At Re2buy, we strive to make buying and selling vehicles smooth and trustworthy.
This Refund & Cancellation Policy outlines when refunds are permitted, how cancellations work, and what steps users should take.
</p>

<h2>2. Applicability</h2>
<p>
This policy applies to all purchases, subscriptions, services, and payments made through the Re2buy platform, including mobile application and website.
</p>

<h2>3. Cancellation of Services</h2>
<p>
Users may cancel any service request or order before it has been confirmed by the service provider or Re2buy team.
Cancellations must be made directly through the app or website, or via customer support.
</p>

<h2>4. Refund Eligibility</h2>
<p>
Refunds will be considered only under the following scenarios:
<ul>
  <li>If a paid service request is not fulfilled by Re2buy or its partner.</li>
  <li>If there was an error in billing or duplicated charges.</li>
  <li>If the user cancels within the allowed cancellation period before service delivery.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>5. Refund Process</h2>
<p>
Refund requests should be submitted through the contact details provided below or via the in-app support feature.  
Once a request is received, our team will review and respond within 7–10 business days.
Approved refunds will be processed to the original payment method used at the time of purchase.
</p>

<h2>6. No Refund Cases</h2>
<p>
Refunds may not be provided in the following cases:
<ul>
  <li>After the service has already been fulfilled or completed.</li>
  <li>User cancellation after delivery or completion of service.</li>
  <li>Non-payment disputes arising from third-party payment processors.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>7. Chargebacks</h2>
<p>
If a user initiates a chargeback through their bank or payment service, Re2buy reserves the right to contest the chargeback if the transaction is verified as valid.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to Policy</h2>
<p>
Re2buy may update this Refund & Cancellation Policy at any time. Updated policies will be effective immediately upon posting. Continued use of the platform indicates acceptance of the updated terms.
